# Demandly: Advanced Demand Forecasting Tool Using Deep Learning

## Overview

Demandly is a comprehensive demand forecasting solution designed to help businesses optimize their supply chain operations by accurately predicting product demand. By leveraging the power of time series analysis, feature engineering, and deep learning with TensorFlow, Demandly enables organizations to anticipate future demand patterns, reduce inventory costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project is built using Python, Pandas for data processing, and LSTM neural networks within TensorFlow to model sequential dependencies inherent in demand data over time.

## Motivation

Accurate demand forecasting is critical for effective supply chain management. Overestimating demand leads to excess inventory and higher holding costs, while underestimating results in stockouts and lost sales. Traditional forecasting models often fail to capture complex temporal patterns such as seasonality, trends, and irregular fluctuations.

Demandly addresses these challenges by using modern deep learning techniques, providing more robust and adaptive forecasting capabilities suited for real-world business data.

## Key Features

- **Time Series Data Handling:** Automatically processes date fields to extract relevant temporal features such as day of week and month, capturing seasonality and weekly cycles.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhances the input data with engineered features that improve model accuracy and generalization.
- **Sequence Modeling:** Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn from sequential demand data, capturing temporal dependencies.
- **Data Scaling:** Applies Min-Max normalization for stable and efficient training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Implements evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) score to quantify forecasting performance.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clear separation of preprocessing, model building, and training scripts for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to support future improvements such as multi-step forecasting and richer feature sets.

## Dataset

Demandly expects a CSV dataset containing historical demand data with at least the following columns:

| Column  | Description             |
|---------|-------------------------|
| `date`  | Date of the observation |
| `demand`| Demand value (numeric)  |

Additional engineered features (`day_of_week`, `month`) are derived automatically during preprocessing.
